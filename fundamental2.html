        <h2>What is the superscript and subcript</h2>
        <p1><pre>           <i> A subscript or superscript is a number, figure, symbol, or indicator that is smaller than their normal line of type 
            and is set slightly below or above it. 
            Subscripts appear at or below the baseline, while superscripts are above. 
            Subscripts and superscripts are perhaps best known for their use in formulas, 
            mathematical expressions, and specifications of chemical compounds and isotopes, 
            but have many other uses as well.</i></pre></p1>
